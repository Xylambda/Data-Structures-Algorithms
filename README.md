# Data-Structures-Algorithms
This repository provides implementations of popular algorithms and abstract data types using JAVA.

## Why does this repository exist?
This repository contains the syllabus for the subject Data Structures and Algorithms I took in Computer Science at UPV. I used it to track the subject.

## Is it complete?
No, the algorithms part got lost, and I am planning to write everything in a more elegant language like Python or C#, but it is not a priority.

## Are the implementation recursive or iterative?
You can find both, but I tend to solve things iteratively for obvious reasons.
